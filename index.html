		<h1>What Is BeatBox ?</h1>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Beatboxing (or b-boxing or beat boxing) is the art of using your mouth to create, and imitate different kinds of noises and sounds.  Stringing these sounds together in the appropriate sequence creates a rhythm.It is (relatively) new artform, and over time, as the years pass by, beatbox has evolved from rather human sounding effects, to producing sounds that are as least human as possible.
			"Beatbox" and "Beat box" redirect here. For other uses, see Beatbox (disambiguation).

Beatboxing (also beat boxing or b-boxing) is a form of vocal percussion primarily involving the art of mimicking drum machines (typically a TR-808), using one's mouth, lips, tongue, and voice.[1] It may also involve vocal imitation of turntablism, and other musical instruments. Beatboxing today is connected with hip-hop culture, often referred to as "the fifth element" of hip-hop, although it is not limited to hip-hop music.[2][3] The term "beatboxing" is sometimes used to refer to vocal percussion in general.
